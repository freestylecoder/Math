# Math

F# math libraries for dealing with non-standard things

This began as a project to give me a random prime number. Basically, I needed everything you see in the Primes project.

From there I began to tinker. I wanted to add more things that normally don't come in a math library. This led to the Combinatorics project.

However, results from combinatoric functions get REALLY big. This got me to create my own data type that can handle integers of any size. That's where we are now.

This Library is severely not ready for primetime. I needed to move the code to another machine, due to current limitations in unit testing on Visual Studio for Mac.
